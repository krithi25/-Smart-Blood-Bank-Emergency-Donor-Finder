# Blood Donation System - Frontend

This is a lightweight React + Vite frontend demo for the Blood Donation System. It uses browser localStorage to simulate a backend database and demonstrates flows for donors, hospitals/banks, donations, blood tests, emergency requests and staff fulfillment.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:/Users/krithika/Downloads/BLOOD_DONATION_SYSTEM/FRONTEND"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Notes:
- This is a demo UI. In a real app you'd hook these operations to a backend database and implement proper auth.
- Data persists in localStorage; to reset, clear the browser site data for the dev URL or run `localStorage.clear()` in the console.
